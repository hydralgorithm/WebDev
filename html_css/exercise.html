            Come up to meet you, tell ya I'm sorry
            You don't know how lovely you are
            I had to find you, tell ya I need you
            Tell you I set you apart

            Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
            Oh, let's go back to the start
            Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
            Heads on a science apart

            Nobody said it was easy
            It's such a shame for us to part
            Nobody said it was easy
            No one ever said it would be this hard
            Oh, take me back to the start

            I was just guessing at numbers and figures
            Pulling the puzzles apart
            Questions of science, science and progress
            Do not speak as loud as my heart

            But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
            Oh, and I rush to the start
            Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails
            Coming back as we are

            Nobody said it was easy
            Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
            Nobody said it was easy
            No one ever said it would be so hard
            I'm going back to the start</div>
